Hi everyone,

  My name is Tyler Bias. I'm originally from central Florida but moved to Pittsburgh in 2008 to attend the University of Pittsburgh. I double-majored in psychology and philosophy. I decided not to pursue either further by entering into a grad program, though both (particularly philosophy) remain major areas of interest and take up a good amount of my personal reading time. I've always really loved computers but for most of my life it was limited to exploring software and customizing programs through extensions and things of that nature.

  Towards the end of my time at Pitt I began to try to learn more earnestly about computers and coding and taught myself some of the basics in visual basic and python (very rudimentary basics, in retrospect). It was enough exposure for me to recognize that I found the process very engaging and satisfyling challenging. I have a friend who completed OSU's post-bacc computer science program and loved his experience in it. I have had a great time so far as well, and I am looking forward to getting to know the material and to work with you all.

  In my free time I enjoy trying to continue to read philosophy/psychoanalysis books, novels, poetry, etc. I play guitar and love music. My main area of interest as of late has been classical music, which has finally started to make some sense to me in the past few months. Other than that my main love is probably punk and indie rock. I live with my girlfriend and our chihuahua/jack russel, Fritz. I have recently gotten back into the world of video games and have been really enjoying some online multiplayer stuff like Call of Duty (I am a major latecomer to online gaming). I also love movies and am eagerly anticipating P.T. Anderson's Inherent Vice at the moment.
