Hi everyone,

  My name is Tyler Bias. I'm originally from central Florida but moved to Pittsburgh in 2008 to attend the University of Pittsburgh. I double-majored in psychology and philosophy. I decided not to pursue either further by entering into a grad program, though both (particularly philosophy) remain major areas of interest and take up a good amount of my personal reading time. I've always really loved computers but for most of my life it was limited to exploring software and customizing programs through extensions and things of that nature.

  Towards the end of my time at Pitt I began to try to learn more earnestly about computers and coding and taught myself some of the basics in visual basic and python (very rudimentary basics, in retrospect). It was enough exposure for me to recognize that I found the process very engaging and satisfyling challenging. I have a friend who completed OSU's post-bacc computer science program and loved his experience in it. I have had a great time so far as well, and I am looking forward to getting to know the material and to work with you all.
